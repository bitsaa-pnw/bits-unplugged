    subtitle: Building with AI at Big Tech and Startups
    description: >
      AI is no longer just a buzzword—it’s the backbone of how companies
      operate, innovate, and scale. But building with AI looks very different
      depending on where you sit. What does it take to drive AI adoption in
      large legacy companies? How do nimble startups leverage cutting-edge
      models to punch above their weight? And how do researchers, builders, and
      business leaders collaborate across the spectrum? This session brings
      together voices from both ends of the spectrum—those shipping fast in
      small teams and those steering transformation in global organizations.
      Expect real-world stories, lessons from the trenches, and a peek into the
      future of building in and with AI.
